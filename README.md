Syntactical extension to Haskell Standard Prelude, focusing on increasing readability and comprehensibility.

Just a trial balloon at this point, but replacing standard Haskell operators with back-ticked function equivalents might be interesting for readability.

Renamed versions of things might also be useful for comprehensibility to newbies / community outsiders (see: timesDo in lieu of replicateM)
